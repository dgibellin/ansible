Ideas for the future

Playbook for deploying certificates
Playbook for renewing certificates
Playbook for checking storage (root, /opt, /var, /var/log, /tmp)
Playbook for checking uptime
Playbook for managing services (just one playbook and a --extra-vars to call out start/stop/restart/status)
Playbook for chronyc sources 
Playbook for checking locked out users via faillock or pam_tally2 (how do I target "all" here? Pull users from /home maybe and register those as variables for later tasks??
Playbook for managing SELinux privleges on SELinux-enabled servers
Playbook for parsing specific log errors
Playbook for checking root logins and showing where they logged in from
Playbook for CPU% (unreliable since Ansible spikes a servers CPU% and gives an unreliable result; maybe better with sar commands or just use Zabbix?)
